# Project README: Image Classification with MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on training an image classification model to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using deep learning techniques. The model was implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: The **MNIST dataset** contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in grayscale.
- **Model Architecture**: A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using Keras.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model is evaluated based on **loss** and **accuracy**.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   To run this project, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can use the following command to install them via `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pandas
   ```

2. **Setup Jupyter Notebook**:
   If you haven’t installed Jupyter, you can do so by running:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

   Then, start Jupyter Notebook with:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser.
   - Navigate to the directory where your notebook is located.
   - Open the notebook and run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## MNIST Dataset

The **MNIST dataset** consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The dataset is split into 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image has an associated label representing the digit it contains.

- **Training set**: 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Test set**: 10,000 images of handwritten digits.

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the dataset is:
- **Normalized**: Pixel values are scaled to a range of 0 to 1.
- **One-hot encoded**: Labels are converted to one-hot encoded vectors for classification.

## Model Details

The model used in this project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The CNN includes multiple layers for extracting features from the images and making predictions.

- **Convolutional layers**: These layers help in extracting local features from the images.
- **MaxPooling layers**: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the image, making it easier for the model to process.
- **Dense layers**: These layers help in decision-making based on the features learned by the convolutional layers.

### Model Training

The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** for 10 epochs using the **categorical cross-entropy** loss function and the **Adam optimizer**.

### Evaluation

After training, the model was evaluated using the following results:

- **Loss**: 0.040995948016643524
- **Accuracy**: 98.75%

This indicates that the model performed well, with a low loss and a high accuracy on the test dataset. The model is able to make accurate predictions for handwritten digits.

### Code Walkthrough

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras' built-in dataset loading function.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is normalized by scaling pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
   - The labels are one-hot encoded for categorical classification.

3. **Model Definition**:
   - A CNN model is defined with convolutional, max-pooling, and dense layers.

4. **Model Compilation**:
   - The model is compiled with the **categorical cross-entropy** loss and the **Adam optimizer**.

5. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained for 10 epochs, with early stopping used to avoid overfitting.

6. **Prediction**:
   - After training, the model's predictions are obtained using `model.predict()`, and the predicted class labels are processed using `argmax()`.

7. **Evaluation**:
   - The model’s performance is evaluated using the **classification report** and **confusion matrix**, which provide insights into the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each digit class.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells in sequence to:
   - Load the MNIST dataset.
   - Preprocess the data (normalization and one-hot encoding).
   - Define, compile, and train the CNN model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

## Example Output

After running the notebook, you will see the following evaluation results:

```python
[0.040995948016643524, 0.987500011920929]
```

- **Loss**: 0.040995948016643524 (indicating the error between the predicted and actual labels is very low).
- **Accuracy**: 0.9875 (indicating the model correctly predicted the labels 98.75% of the time).

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all required libraries are installed correctly.
- If you encounter any issues with model training or evaluation, check the shapes of your input data (`X_train`, `X_test`) and labels (`y_train`, `y_test`).
- Make sure that your dataset is loaded and preprocessed correctly before passing it into the model.

## Conclusion

The **MNIST** image classification model successfully predicts handwritten digits with an accuracy of 98.75%, demonstrating strong performance on the test dataset. This notebook serves as a simple yet effective implementation of a CNN for digit classification.
